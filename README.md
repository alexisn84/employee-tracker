## Description
An application that allows the user to create employees, roles and departments, while also editing roles and deleting employees. The application allows several different view filters so that a user is not forced to search thru unneccessary departments. While using MySQL to store certain data into different tables that then "talk" to each other to ensure the program is not slowed down.
